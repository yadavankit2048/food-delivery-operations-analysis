# Phase 1: Order to Pickup Time Analysis

## Objective
To analyze how long it takes for orders to be picked up after being placed,
and to understand how this time varies across operational conditions.

---

## Key Questions Addressed
- How is order-to-pickup time distributed?
- Do averages hide operational delays?
- How does traffic density affect pickup time?
- Does city type influence pickup efficiency?

---

## Metrics Used
- Order_to_pickup_minutes
- Pickup time buckets (<5, 5–10, 10–15, >15 minutes)
- Percentage distribution
- Count distribution

---

## Analysis Approach
- Used Pivot Tables for aggregation
- Analyzed both count and percentage distributions
- Avoided relying only on averages to prevent misleading conclusions

---

## Output Files
- Excel file with pivot tables
- Written insights summarizing findings
