# Phase 1: Order to Pickup Time Analysis

Objective:
To analyze how long restaurants take to prepare orders after they are placed,
and how this time varies across traffic conditions and city types.

Why this matters:
Order-to-pickup time reflects restaurant efficiency and kitchen readiness.
Delays here cascade into delivery delays and impact customer satisfaction.

In this phase, we:
- Cleaned and standardized time data
- Created time buckets (<5, 5–10, 10–15, >15 minutes)
- Analyzed distributions instead of relying only on averages
- Compared pickup time across traffic density and city types

Key takeaway:
Averages appeared similar across categories, but distribution analysis revealed
meaningful operational differences.
